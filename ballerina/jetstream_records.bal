#
# + name - A name for the stream
# + description - A short description of the purpose of this stream 
# + subjects - Which NATS subject/subjects to populate this stream with. Supports wildcards. Defaults to just the
#              configured stream name
# + retentionPolicy - How message retention is considered, Limits (default), Interest or WorkQueue
# + maxConsumers - How many consumers can be defined for the stream, -1 for unlimited
# + maxMsgs - How large the stream may become in total messages before the configured discard policy takes action
# + maxMsgsPerSubject - Maximum amount of messages to retain per subject 
# + maxBytes - How large the stream may become in total bytes before the configured discard policy takes action
# + maxAge - Maximum age of any message in the stream, expressed in seconds  
# + maxMsgSize - The largest message that will be accepted by the Stream  
# + storageType - The type of storage backend, File and Memory
# + replicas - The number of replicas to store this message on
# + noAck - If set, then acknowledgements are not sent back to the client
# + discardPolicy - When a stream has reached its configured maxBytes or maxMsgs, this policy takes action
